Creating Servers with Express.js
    -   Its a framework which helps us build web apps
    -   It's just a NPM package which comes with a bunch of methods and optional plugins which helps us build web app and api's.
    -   Important functionalities
        -   start up a server to listen for requests
        -   parse incoming requests
        -   match those requests to particular routes
        -   craft our http response and associated content
    -   For every incoming request we have two parameters for the .use function 
        -   request object
        -   response object
    -   HTTP request is atext information but express converts it into javascript object
    -   Routing
        -   A concept common with every framework
        -   It means taking an incoming request which consists of path and then matching with that to code and some response
        -   Every http request always responds only once
        -   rutes are matched in order
    -   Query String
        -   its a portion of the url that comes after ? and contains key-value pairs

Templating and Express
    -   Templating allows us to set 'preset' pattern for a webpage, that we dynamically modify
    -   for ex. we can create a single search template which displays all the results. We don't know how many or which results
    -   are there. It is filled in on the fly.
    -   if we are going to use some templating, express is going to assume that our templates exist in a directory named views
    -   and now isntead of sending string via res.send, we will send a view using render function
    -    by default if we are in a different directory than index.js then the views folder doesnt work 

    -   EJS
        -   <%= ... %> : Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped). (the output is rendered)
        -   <% ... %> : The output is not rendered
