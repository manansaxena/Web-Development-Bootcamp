Modules
    -   basically a way to link between separate js files. For example we might define some functionality in a different js files
        and we require in this file. Similar to import.
    -   by default we get an empty object when we import it in other file. We have to specify what we want to export using
        module.export and that is what goes into the other file
    -   multiple ways to do it, check math.js

    -   Requiring a Directory
        -   Many a times we may have a sub directory which has many files all linked to get one feature, we may want to include
            the directory in our main file
        -   To do this, we create an index file in that sub directory which has an array fetching all the other modules in that sub directory
        -   Whatever,  index exports so will the entire directory. Index is like an entry point
    
    -   NPM
        -   A library of thousands of packages made by other developers
        -   A command line tool to easily install those packages and manage them in our
            node projects
        -   When we install a package, we also get a bunch of dependent modules stored in node-module folder
            We also get a package-lock.json which basically enlists the version of various dependent modules
        -   Local vs Global Installation of packages
            -   Locally installed packages can't be used in other folders
            -   To install something globally we add the '-g' flag and we may have to use npm link package_name to link it for local use 
        -   Package.json
            -   Basically contains the meta data like version, liscense, dependencies etc
            -   we should use npm init to make our initial packages.json
            -   now when we install a package we dont get a warning and it would show the package in dependencies
            -   we don't usually share node modules when sharing the code, instead we share the package.json
            -   to install all dependencies listed in package.json we use only "npm install"
