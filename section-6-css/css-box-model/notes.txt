1) Main parts in a box model 
    - Content box
    - padding
    - border
    - margin
2) In very basic form, width and height defines the size of the Content box
3) Main properties of border:
    - border-width
    - border-color
    - border-style
4) box-sizing: border-box;  /* If we use this then it sets the total length to be width and height and hence the border eats out the space of content-box*/
5) border: width/style/color
6) padding is the space between your content box and the border.
7) padding has following properties-
    - individual properties
        - padding-left, padding-right, padding-top, padding-bottom
    - shorthand property
        - set all four sides at once
8) 4 different ways of using padding 
    -padding: 10px; Apply to all four sides
    -padding: 5px 10px; Vertical | Horizontal
    -padding: 5px 10px 5px; Top|Horizontal|Bottom
    -padding: 10px 10px 0 20px; top|right|bottom|left
9) Margin is the spacing outside of the border, typically between two elements. Similar to padding we have individual and shorthand properties.
10) Display property first encounter - 
    - Inline -  Width and Height are ignored. Margin and padding push element away horizontallly but not vertically.
    - Block - Block elements break the flow of the document. Width, Height, padding and margin all are respected.
    - Inline-Block - behave like an inline element but all four are respected.
11) CSS Units
    -percentage - it's always relative to something. Maybe to parent element or sometimes to the element itself.
    - rems and ems - just look at the video if ever stuck!!
