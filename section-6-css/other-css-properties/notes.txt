1) Alpha Channel
    - rgba(250,120,140,0.5) 
    - varies between 0 and 1 with 0 being transparent and 1 being opaque.
    - it will only effect the background-color of the element
2) Opacity 
    - Its a standalone property unlike alpha channel.
    - it governs the transparency of all its content and its descendent unlike alpha channel
    - it also goes from 0 to 1 
3) Position property
    - its sets how an element is positioned in the document
    - static 
        - the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. 
        - top, right, bottom, left, z-index have no effect. This is the default value
    - relative
        - the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document
        - but can be offseted related to itself depending on the values of top,right,bottom,left
    - absolute
        - element is removed from the normal flow of the document and no space is created for it
        - it is positioned relative to it's closest positioned parent else its relative to the intial containing block 
    - fixed
        - element is removed from the normal flow of the document and no space is created for it
        - it is always positioned relative to the initial containing block. Hence, it is fixed even if we scroll down
    - sticky
        - it's not fixed first but once it reaches the top on scrolling it gets fixed.
4) Transition format 
    - Property name|duration|timing function|delay
    - we can use all for all properties
