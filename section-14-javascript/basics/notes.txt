Basics

1) Primitive Types:
    - Number
    - String
    - Boolean
    - Null 
    - Undefined
    - Symbol
    - BigInt
2) REPL - Read Evaluate Print Loop
3) Numbers-
    - JS has only one number type which includes positive, negative, whole(integers), decimals
    - And obviously there is a hard limit on how big or how much memory a number can store
    - Follows BODMAS
    - NaN:
        - Not a number
        - numeric value that represents domwthing that is .. not a number
        - 0/0, 1+ NaN
        - typeof NaN shows a number
        - Number.isNaN(NaN) => true

5) Variables - 
    - They are like labels for values
    - We can store a value and give it a name so that we can 
        - refer back to it later
        - use that value to do ... stuff
        - or change it later
    - syntax
        - let someName = value;
        - score +=,-=,*=,/= 3
        - score ++, score--
    - Const: Works just like let but you cannot change the value
    - Var: was the old and only way to make a variable
    - variables in javascript can change types. So we can change a numeric variable to boolean if we want.
6) Boolean can take two values - true or false
    - syntax    
        - let someName = true;
7) variable naming conventions
    - no spaces
    - can't start with a digit
    - can contain _ and $ too.
    - we use camel case in which each new word starts with uppercase except for the first word
    - putting in "is" for boolean variable is goo. Like isGameOver instead of gameOver
