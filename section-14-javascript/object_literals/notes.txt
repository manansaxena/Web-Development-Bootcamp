Objects
    - Are like dicitonaries in python
    - are collection of properties
    - properties are key-value pairs
    - rather than accessing data using an index we use custom keys
    - every key we are making in an object gets converted to a string
    - difference between the two access method is that in [] these we can put an expression of code which will be evaluated first.
    - object and array can be mixeed together in anyway
