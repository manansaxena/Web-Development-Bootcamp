Strings
    - They represent text and must be wrapped in quotes.
    - we can use either double or single. But remember consitent in codebase.
    - we can use the other type of quote within a quote
    - they are indexed with index starting from 0.
    - has a function - length
    - can't update one character at a time, can only completely overwrite the string.
    - strings have built in methods
        - syntax 
            - thing.method()
            - for methods with arguments
                - thing.method(arg)
    - for slice if negative, then the beginIndex = string.length + beginIndex(given).
    - Template Literals
        - are strings that allow embedded expressions, which wiil be evaluated and then turned into a resulting string.
        - it should be in back-ticks
        - `I counted ${3+7} sheeps` => "I counted 7 sheeps"

Undefined and Null primitive types
    - Null  
        - intentional absence of any value
        - must be assigned
    - Undefined 
        - variables that do not have any assigned value are undefined.

Math Object
    - contains properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions
    - Math.random() gives a random number between 0 and 1(not inclusive).
