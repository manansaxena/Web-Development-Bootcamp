default params - just a way to pass in default values to function parameters.
               - default params should always come after parameters who dont have a default value

spread
    - allows an iterable such as an array to be expanded(that mean remove the [] and treat each one of them as a single argument
      and not as one huge block) in places where zero or more arguments(for function calls) or elements(array literals) are expected
      or an object expression to be expanded in places where 0 or more key-value pairs(for object literals) are required
    - for function calls    
        - expands an iterable(array,string etc) into a list of arguments
    - for array literals
        - create a new array using an existing array. Spreads the element from one array into a new array
    - for object literals
        - copies properties of one object into another object literal
        - if a property clashes, then the one that comes later wins

Arguments object - 
    - In every function we have this object
    - It's an array-like object
        - has a length property and floows indexing
        - doesn't have array like methods
    - contains all arguments passed to the function
    - not available in arrow function
rest params
    - collects all remaining arguments into an actual array
destructuring arrays
    - an easier way to get values from array to be stored in variables

destructuring object
    - helps us pull out properties
    - if we want to rename them use :
    - if we want to set default values iff they doesnt exist in the object then use =

destructuring params
    - helps us in destructuring the params passed to functions
        - ex - if we want only two properties of the object then only take two out of them by using destructuring
