Arrays-
    - Ordered collection of values
    - typeof gives object
    - index starts with 0
    - if we have an array of length 3 and we try to assign something to index 10 then the indexes in between are filled with undefined.
    - methods
        - push (end)
        - pop (end)
        - shift (remove from start)
        - unshift (add to start)
        - concat (merge arrays)
        - includes (looks for a value)
        - indexOf (just like string indexOf)
        - join (creates a string from an array)
        - reverse (reverses an array) // destructive method that is it changes the original
        - slice (copies a portion of an array)
        - splice (removes/replaces elements)
            - destructive
            - syntax -
                - array.splice(start,items_to_delete,items_to_add/replace with)
        - sort (sorts an array) // converts each entry into string and then compares their utf-16 code values.
        - === will give false even if two arrays are same because JS compares the memory reference and not what inside the array
        - const is used with array because the variable acts as a reference to the memory address, so we can change anything in the 
          array. But the address or reference would remain the same
        - Nested Arrays - 
            - we can store arrays in an arrays
