Decisions

1) Comparisons-
    - >,<,>=,<=,==,!= (The obivious ones)
    - === (strict equality)
    - !== (strict inequality)
    - ==
        - Checks for equality of value, but not equality of type
        - It coerces both values to the same type and then compares them.
        - This can lead to some unexpected values.
    - ===
        - Check for equality of value and type
2) Console
    - .log - prints argument to the console
    - .warn - gives out a warning
    - .error - to send out error
3) alert - to send out annoying pop up alert
4) prompt - asks user for an input - we get a string
5) parseInt - used to convert string to integer
            - If we write something like '101dasjda' then it would give us 101 only.
6) Conditional Statements
    - if - look for syntax in code file

7) Truthyness and Falsyness
    - Every value in JS has an inherent Truthyness or Falsyness about them
    - All values are truthy except
        - false 
        - 0
        - ""
        - null
        - undefined
        - NaN
8) 3 major logical operators -
    &&, ||, ! - and, or, not
