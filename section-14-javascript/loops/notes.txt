Loops
    - Different types
        - for
        - while
        - for...of
        - for...in
    - Infinite Loops    
    - Nested

Iterating over an object_literal
    - for...of doesnt work as object_literal isn't iterable
    - we can use the for...in which gives us only the keys of the object_literal.
        - for...in is very rarely used nowadays.
    - or we can use object_literal methods
        - Object.keys(object_literal) # gives us an array of keys
        - Object.values(object_literal) # gives us an array of values
        - Object.enteries(object_literal) # gives us a nested list of object_literal
