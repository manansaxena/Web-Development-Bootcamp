			<b>Liverpool Football Club</b> is a professional football club in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool">Liverpool</a>,
			England, that competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English
			football. Domestically, the club has won nineteen League titles, seven FA
			Cups, a record eight League Cups and fifteen FA Community Shields. In
			international competitions, the club has won six European Cups, more than
			any other English club, three UEFA Cups, four UEFA Super Cups (also English
			records) and one FIFA Club World Cup.
		</p>

			Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and
			has played at Anfield since its formation. Liverpool established itself as a
			major force in English and European football in the 1970s and 1980s, when
			Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish led the club to a
			combined eleven League titles and four European Cups. Liverpool won two
			further European Cups in 2005 and 2019 under the management of Rafael
			Benítez and Jürgen Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a
			nineteenth League title in 2020, the club's first during the Premier League
			era.

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			Liverpool played their first match on 1 September 1892, a pre-season
			friendly match against Rotherham Town, which they won 7–1. The team
			Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed entirely of Scottish
			players – the players who came from Scotland to play in England in those
			days were known as the Scotch Professors. Manager John McKenna had recruited
			the players after a scouting trip to Scotland – so they became known as the
			"team of Macs".[10] The team won the Lancashire League in its debut season,
			and joined the Football League Second Division at the start of the 1893–94
			season. After the club was promoted to the First Division in 1896, Tom
			Watson was appointed manager. He led Liverpool to its first league title in
			1901, before winning it again in 1906.[11]

		<h2>Colours and Badge</h2>
		<p>
			For much of Liverpool's history its home colours have been all red, but when
			the club was founded its kit was more like the contemporary Everton kit. The
			blue and white quartered shirts were used until 1894, when the club adopted
			the city's colour of red.[8] The city's symbol of the liver bird was adopted
			as the club's badge in 1901, although it was not incorporated into the kit
			until 1955. Liverpool continued to wear red shirts and white shorts until
			1964, when manager Bill Shankly decided to change to an all red strip.[59]
			Liverpool played in all red for the first time against Anderlecht, as Ian St
			John recalled in his autobiography:
