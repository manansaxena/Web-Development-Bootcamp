Section 39 - Campground Cruds
    -   Create a basic express app

Section 40 - Middleware (Express)
    -   Express middleware are functions that run during requests/response lifecycle
    -   Middleware are just function that run between getting the request and send the response.
    -   Each middleware has access to the request and response objects
    -   Middleware can send a HTTP request by sending back a response with methods like res.send()
    -   OR middleware can be chained together,one after the another by calling next().
    -   Morgan - a logging middleware
    -   next() is used to run the next middleware inline, considering whichever matches the route
    -   we have to know that we can send only one respone per request, so even if we try next() after a send then it won't do anything
    -   More on app.use()
        -   we can specify paths, to make sure that middleware runs only when we hit that route
        -   in middleware we usually send next but in route handlers we render something
        -   we can use app.use to perform a default 404 behaviour
    -   most common pattern is to put it with one of the app routers, get,post ... 

Section 41 - Adding basic styles - Yelpcamp
    -  ejs-mate 
        -   gives additional functionality to ejs
        -   it has a property called layout, which allows us to create boilerplates
        -   we have <%-body%> in boilerplate and for rest of the files we only keep the elements in body tag and 
            use <% layout(path to boilerplate)%>
